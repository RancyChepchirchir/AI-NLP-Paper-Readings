|[Affect-LM: A Neural Language Model for Customizable Affective Text Generation](https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/papers/P17-1059/p17-1059)|ACL 2017|1. The problem of integrating state-of-the-art neural language models with affective information remains an unexplored area. 2. The proposed model Affect-LM enables us to customize the degree of emotional content in generated sentences through an additional design parameter|
|[Breaking the Softmax Bottleneck: A High-Rank RNN Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.03953)|ICLR 2017|1. Formulate language modeling as a matrix factorization problem, and show that the expressiveness of Softmax-based models (including the majority of neural language models) is limited by a Softmax bottleneck. 2. Propose a simple mixture of Softmax to address this issue|
