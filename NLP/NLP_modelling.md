|[Affect-LM: A Neural Language Model for Customizable Affective Text Generation](https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/papers/P17-1059/p17-1059)|ACL 2017|1. The problem of integrating state-of-the-art neural language models with affective information remains an unexplored area. 2. The proposed model Affect-LM enables us to customize the degree of emotional content in generated sentences through an additional design parameter|
|[Hybrid Computing Using a Neural Network with Dynamic External Memory](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20101)|Nature 2016| Traditional neural networks are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures and to store data over long timescales owing the lack of an external memory. This paper proposes a machine learning model called a differential neural computer (DNC), which consists of a neural network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix, analogous to the RAM in a conventional computer.|
