|[Toward Controlled Generation of Text](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00955)|ICML 2017|1. Aims at generating plausible natural language sentences, whose attributes are dynamically controlled by learning disentangled latent representations with designated semantics. 2. Propose a new neural generative model which combines variational auto-encoders and holistic attribute discriminators for effective imposition of semantic structures. 3. The proposed model learns highly interpretable representations from even only word annotations, and produces realistic sentences with desired attributes.|
