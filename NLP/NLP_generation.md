|[Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks](https://aclanthology.info/papers/P17-1099/p17-1099)|ACL 2017|A novel architecture that augments the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two orthogonal ways. 1.

Uses coverage to keep track of what has been summarized, which discourages repetition.|
