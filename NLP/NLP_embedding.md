|[GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1162)|EMNLP 2014|1.  A new global log-bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods|
|[Hybrid Computing Using a Neural Network with Dynamic External Memory](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20101)|Nature 2016| Traditional neural networks are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures and to store data over long timescales owing the lack of an external memory. This paper proposes a machine learning model called a differential neural computer (DNC), which consists of a neural network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix, analogous to the RAM in a conventional computer.|
