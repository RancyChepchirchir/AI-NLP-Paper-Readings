|[On the Evaluation of Dialogue Systems with Next Utterance Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05414)|Arxiv 2016|1. Investigate the performance of humans on this task to validate the relevance of Next Utterance Classification (NUC) as a method of evaluation. 2. Results show three main findings: (1) humans are able to correctly classify responses at a rate much better than chance, thus confirming that the task is feasible, (2) human performance levels vary across task domains (we consider 3 datasets) and expertise levels (novice vs experts), thus showing that a range of performance is possible on this type of task, (3) automated dialogue systems built using state-of-the-art machine learning methods have similar performance to the human novices, but worse than the experts, thus confirming the utility of this class of tasks for driving further research in automated dialogue systems.|
|[Multi-Turn Response Selection for Chatbots with Deep Attention Matching Network](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1103)|ACL 2018|1. Investigate matching a response with its multi-turn context using dependency information based entirely on attention. 2. First, construct representations of text segments at different granularities solely with stacked self-attention. Second, extract the truly matched segment pairs with attention across the context and response. We jointly introduce those two kinds of attention in one uniform neural network.|
|[Improving Response Selection in Multi-Turn Dialogue Systems by Incorporating Domain Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03194)|CoNLL 2018| Proposes a novel neural network architecture for response selection in an end-to-end multi-turn conversational dialogue setting. The architecture applies context level attention and incorporates additional external knowledge provided by descriptions of domain-specific words.|
