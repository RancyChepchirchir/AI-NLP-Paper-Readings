|[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dialogue Generation](https://aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1127)|EMNLP 2016|1. Current conversational agents tend to be short-sighted and ignoring long-term interactivity. 2. Combination of traditional NLP model with reinforcement learning to model future rewards in chatbot dialogue to learn a neural conversational model based on long-term success of dialogues. 3. Rewards: informative, coherence and ease-of-answering. 4. Model evaluation metrices: diversity, conversation length and human judges|
|[Hybrid Computing Using a Neural Network with Dynamic External Memory](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20101)|Nature 2016| Traditional neural networks are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures and to store data over long timescales owing the lack of an external memory. This paper proposes a machine learning model called a differential neural computer (DNC), which consists of a neural network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix, analogous to the RAM in a conventional computer.|
