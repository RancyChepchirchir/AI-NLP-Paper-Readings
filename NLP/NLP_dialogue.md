|[A Neural Conversational Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05869)|Arxiv 2015|1. Present a simple approach for conversation modelling which uses the recently proposed sequence to sequence framework. 2. It can be trained end-to-end and thus requires much fewer hand-crafted rules|
|[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dialogue Generation](https://aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1127)|EMNLP 2016|1. Current conversational agents tend to be short-sighted and ignoring long-term interactivity. 2. Combination of traditional NLP model with reinforcement learning to model future rewards in chatbot dialogue to learn a neural conversational model based on long-term success of dialogues. 3. Rewards: informative, coherence and ease-of-answering. 4. Model evaluation metrices: diversity, conversation length and human judges|
|[A Survey on Dialogue Systems: Recent Advances and New Frontiers](http://www.kdd.org/exploration_files/19-2-Article3.pdf)|ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter 2017| 1. Task-oriented and non-task oriented models. 2. How deep learning help the representation. 3. Some appealing research directions.|
|[Emotional Chatting Machine: Emotional Conversation Generation with Internal and External Memory](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/download/16455/15753)|AAAI 2018|1. Models high-level abstraction of emotion expressions by embedding emotion categories. 2. Captures the change of implicit internal emotion states. 3. Uses explicit emotion expressions with an external emotion vocabulary|
|[Affective Neural Response Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03968)|ECIR 2018| 1.  Propose three novel ways to incorporate affective aspects into LSTM encoder-decoder neural conversation models: Affective word embeddings, affect-based objective functions, affectively diverse beam search for decoding. 2. Experiments show that the proposed model produce emotionally rich responses that are more interesting and natural|
