|[A Neural Conversational Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05869)|Arxiv 2015|1. Present a simple approach for conversation modelling which uses the recently proposed sequence to sequence framework. 2. It can be trained end-to-end and thus requires much fewer hand-crafted rules|
|[A Persona-Based Neural Conversation Model](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1094)|ACL 2016|1. Present persona-based models for handling the issue of speaker consistency in neural response generation. 2. Yield qualitative performance improvements in both perplexity and BLEU scores over baseline sequence-to-sequence models, with similar gains in speaker consistency as measured by human judges.|
|[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dialogue Generation](https://aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1127)|EMNLP 2016|1. Current conversational agents tend to be short-sighted and ignoring long-term interactivity. 2. Combination of traditional NLP model with reinforcement learning to model future rewards in chatbot dialogue to learn a neural conversational model based on long-term success of dialogues. 3. Rewards: informative, coherence and ease-of-answering. 4. Model evaluation metrices: diversity, conversation length and human judges|
|[How NOT To Evaluate Your Dialogue System: An Empirical Study of Unsupervised Evaluation Metrics for Dialogue Response Generation](https://aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1230)|EMNLP 2016|1. Investigate evaluation metrics for dialogue response generation systems where supervised labels, such as task completion, are not available. 2. Show that current automatic metrics correlate very weakly with human judgement in the non-technical Twitter domain, and not at all in the technical Ubuntu domain|
|[Building End-To-End Dialogue Systems Using Generative Hierarchical Neural Network Models](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/11957/12160)|AAAI 2016|1. Extend the recently proposed hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder neural network to the dialogue domain, and demonstrate that this model is competitive with state-of-the-art neural language models and back-off n-gram models. 2. Investigate the limitations of this and similar approaches, and show how its performance can be improved by bootstrapping the learning from a larger question-answer pair corpus and from pretrained word embeddings|
|[Topic Aware Neural Response Generation](https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI17/paper/download/14563/14260)|AAAI 2016|1. Consider incorporating topic information into the sequence-to-sequence framework to generate informative and interesting responses for chatbots. 2. Utilizes topics to simulate prior knowledge of human that guides them to form informative and interesting responses in conversation, and leverages the topic information in generation by a joint attention mechanism and a biased generation probability.|
|[A Simple, Fast Diverse Decoding Algorithm for Neural Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08562)|Arxiv 2016|1. Propose a simple, fast decoding algorithm that fosters diversity in neural generation. 2. Diverse decoding helps across tasks of dialogue response generation, abstractive summarization and machine translation, especially those for which reranking is needed|
|[Generative Deep Neural Networks for Dialogue: A Short Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.06216)|Arxiv 2016|Review recently proposed models based on generative encoder-decoder neural network architectures, and show that these models have better ability to incorporate long-term dialogue history, to model uncertainty and ambiguity in dialogue, and to generate responses with high-level compositional structure.|
|[Adversarial Learning for Neural Dialogue Generation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1230)|EMNLP 2017| 1. Propose using adversarial training for open-domain dialogue generation: the system is trained to produce sequences that are indistinguishable from human-generated dialogue utterances. 2. Cast the task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem where we jointly train two systems, a generative model to produce response sequences, and a discriminator---analagous to the human evaluator in the Turing test--- to distinguish between the human-generated dialogues and the machine-generated ones. 3. Some appealing research directions.|
|[A Survey on Dialogue Systems: Recent Advances and New Frontiers](http://www.kdd.org/exploration_files/19-2-Article3.pdf)|ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter 2017| 1. Task-oriented and non-task oriented models. 2. How deep learning help the representation. 3. Some appealing research directions.|
|[Emotional Chatting Machine: Emotional Conversation Generation with Internal and External Memory](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/download/16455/15753)|AAAI 2018|1. Models high-level abstraction of emotion expressions by embedding emotion categories. 2. Captures the change of implicit internal emotion states. 3. Uses explicit emotion expressions with an external emotion vocabulary|
|[Affective Neural Response Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03968)|ECIR 2018| 1.  Propose three novel ways to incorporate affective aspects into LSTM encoder-decoder neural conversation models: Affective word embeddings, affect-based objective functions, affectively diverse beam search for decoding. 2. Experiments show that the proposed model produce emotionally rich responses that are more interesting and natural|
