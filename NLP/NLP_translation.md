|[Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473)|ICLR 2015|Conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly.|
