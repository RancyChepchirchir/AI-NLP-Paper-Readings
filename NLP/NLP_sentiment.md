|[Comparing and Combining Sentiment Analysis Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0032)|Arxiv 2014|1. Present comparisons of eight popular sentiment analysis methods in terms of coverage (i.e., the fraction of messages whose sentiment is identified) and agreement (i.e., the fraction of identified sentiments that are in tune with ground truth). 2. Develop a new method that combines existing approaches, providing the best coverage results and competitive agreement. 3. Present a free Web service called iFeel, which provides an open API for accessing and comparing results across different sentiment methods for a given text.|
|[Sentiment analysis algorithms and applications: A survey](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090447914000550)|Ain Shams Engineering Journal 2014|1. Give nearly full image of SA techniques and the related fields with brief details. 2. Provide sophisticated categorizations of a large number of recent articles and the illustration of the recent trend of research in the sentiment analysis and its related areas.|
|[Sentiment Analysis: Detecting Valence, Emotions, and Other Affectual States from Text](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081005088000096)|Emotion Measurement 2015|1. Summarize the diverse landscape of tasks and applications associated with sentiment analysis. 2. Outline key challenges stemming from the complexity and subtlety of language use, the prevalence of creative and non-standard language, and the lack of paralinguistic information, such as tone and stress markers. 3. Describe automatic systems and datasets commonly used in sentiment analysis. 4. Summarize several manual and automatic approaches to creating valence- and emotion-association lexicons. 5. Discuss preliminary approaches for sentiment composition (how smaller units of text combine to express sentiment) and approaches for detecting sentiment in figurative and metaphoric language|
|[Sentiment Analysis: Detecting Valence, Emotions, and Other Affectual States from Text](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081005088000096)|Emotion Measurement 2016|1.  Sentiment analysis refers to determining ones' attitude towards a particular target or topic. 2. Osgood et al. (1957) showed three most prominent dimensions of meaning are evaluation (good-bad), potency (strong-weak) and activity (active-passive), or EPA form in short. Another popular form is valence, arousal and dominance, or PAD form by Russell (1980). 3. Sentiment analysis has wide-ranging applications in healthcare, politics, brand management, education, etc.|
|[Linguistically Regularized LSTM for Sentiment Classification](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1154)|ACL 2017| 1. A simple model trained with sentence-level annotations which attempt to model the linguistic role of sentiment lexicons, negation words and intensity words|
|[EmoNet: Fine-Grained Emotion Detection with Gated Recurrent Neural Networks](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1067)|ACL 2017| 1. Create a very large dataset of size 1.6 million tweets for 24 fine-grained emotions. 2. Build a very deep GRU model for sentiment classification with state of the art result.|
|[EMOBANK: Studying the Impact of Annotation Perspective and Representation Format on Dimensional Emotion Analysis](http://aclweb.org/anthology/E17-2092)|EACL 2017| 1. A corpus of 10k English sentences with VAD annotations. 2. A subset of 1200 English sentences with both VAD and Ekman six basic emotion ratings. 3. Both reader and writer perspectives. 4. Close-to-human performance for mapping between dimensional and categorical formats|
|[Attention Modeling for Targeted Sentiment](http://leoncrashcode.github.io/Documents/EACL2017.pdf)|EACL 2017| A vanilla LSTM model is used to induce an attention value of the whole sentence. The model is further extended to differentiate left and right contexts given a certain target following previous work|
|[Attention-Based LSTM for Target-Dependent Sentiment Classification](http://leoncrashcode.github.io/Documents/EACL2017.pdf)|EACL 2017| Learns the alignment between the target entities and the most distinguishing features.|
|[Deep LSTM with Attention for Message-level and Topic-based Sentiment Analysis](http://aclweb.org/anthology/S17-2126)|SemEval 2017| 1. Two-layers LSTM with attention, on top of word embeddings. 2. Present a text processing tool for twitter dataset|
