|[POMDP-based Statistical Spoken Dialogue Systems: a Review](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~sjy/papers/ygtw13.pdf)|Proceedings of IEEE 2013|1. By including an explicit Bayesian model of uncertainty and by optimizing the policy via a reward-driven process, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a data-driven framework for dialog modelling. 2.
