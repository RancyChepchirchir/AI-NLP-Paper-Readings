|[Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)|NIPS 2017|1. Propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. 2. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.|
|[Tutorial on Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05908)|Arxiv 2016|1. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as one of the most popular approaches to unsupervised learning of complicated distributions. 2. VAEs have already shown promise in generating many kinds of complicated data, including handwritten digits, faces, house numbers, CIFAR images, physical models of scenes, segmentation, and predicting the future from static images. 3. Introduces the intuitions behind VAEs, explains the mathematics behind them, and describes some empirical behavior.|
|[Adversarially Regularized Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04223)|ICML 2018|1. Propose a flexible method for training deep latent variable models of discrete structures. 2. Extend WVAE to model discrete sequences, and then further explore different learned priors targeting a controllable representation. 3. The proposed model allows us to generate natural textual outputs as well as perform manipulations in the latent space to induce change in the output space.|
