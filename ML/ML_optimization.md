|[Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a.old/srivastava14a.pdf)|JMLR 2014|The key idea is to randomly drop units during training, which prevents units from co-adapting too much.|
|[Using Kinect for real-time emotion recognition via facial expressions](http://www.jzus.zju.edu.cn/opentxt.php?doi=10.1631/FITEE.1400209)|FIETT 2015| 1. A real-time emotion recognition approach based on both 2D and 3D facial expression features captured by Kinect sensors. 2. To capture the deformation of 3D mesh during facial expression, the features of animation units and feature point positions are combined. 3. A fusion algorithm based on improved emotional profiles (IEPs) and maximum confidence is proposed to recognize emotions. 4. Show superior performance of our method.|
