|[A Kernel Two-Sample Test](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/gretton12a/gretton12a.pdf)|JMLR 2012| 1. Propose a framework for analyzing and comparing distributions, which we use to construct statistical tests to determine if two samples are drawn from different distributions. 2. The proposed test statistic is the largest difference in expectations over functions in the unit ball of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and is called the _maximum mean discrepancy_ (MMD).|
