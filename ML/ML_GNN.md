|[The Emerging Field of Signal Processing on Graphs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6494675)|IEEE Signal Processing Magazine 2013|1. Outline the main challenges of the area, discuss different ways to define graph spectral domains, which are the analogs to the classical frequency domain, and highlight the importance of incorporating the irregular structures of graph data domains when processing signals on graphs. 2. Review methods to generalize fundamental operations such as filtering, translation, modulation, dilation, and downsampling to the graph setting and survey the localized, multiscale transforms that have been proposed to efficiently extract information from high-dimensional data on graphs.|
