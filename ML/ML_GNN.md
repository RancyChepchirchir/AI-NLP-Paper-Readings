|[The Emerging Field of Signal Processing on Graphs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6494675)|IEEE Signal Processing Magazine 2013|1. Outline the main challenges of the area, discuss different ways to define graph spectral domains, which are the analogs to the classical frequency domain, and highlight the importance of incorporating the irregular structures of graph data domains when processing signals on graphs. 2. Review methods to generalize fundamental operations such as filtering, translation, modulation, dilation, and downsampling to the graph setting and survey the localized, multiscale transforms that have been proposed to efficiently extract information from high-dimensional data on graphs.|
|[Geometric deep learning: going beyond Euclidean data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08097)|Arxiv 2017|Overview different examples of geometric deep learning problems and present available solutions, key difficulties, applications, and future research directions in this nascent field.|
|[A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00596)|Arxiv 2018|1. Propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. 2. Discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes and benchmarks of the existing algorithms on different learning tasks. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.|
