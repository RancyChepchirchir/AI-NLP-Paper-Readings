|[The Emerging Field of Signal Processing on Graphs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6494675)|IEEE Signal Processing Magazine 2015|1. Develop a scalable deep conditional generative model for structured output variables using Gaussian latent variables. 2. Provide novel strategies to build a robust structured prediction algorithms, such as recurrent prediction network architecture, input noise-injection and multi-scale prediction training methods.|
