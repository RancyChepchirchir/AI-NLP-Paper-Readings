|[A Survey of Affect Recognition Methods: Audio, Visual, and Spontaneous Expressions](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/media/uploads/documents/PAMI-AVemotionSurvey-CAMERA.pdf)|IEEE TPAMI 2009|1. Discuss human emotion perception from a psychological perspective. 2. Examine available approaches for emotion recognition, and important issues like the collection and availability of training and test data. 3. Outline some challenges for affect recognition|

|[Multimodal Affect Recognition using Kinect](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02652)|Arxiv 2016|This research used color and depth sensing devices such as Kinect for facial feature extraction and tracking human body joints. Features: temporal features across multiple frames; decision level fusion with majority voting; combination of emotion templates and supervised learning. Results: better recognition than supervised learning alone; better recognition than position based features only.|
