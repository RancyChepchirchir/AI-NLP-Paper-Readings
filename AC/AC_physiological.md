RGBD data from 150 individuals aged 7-80 from various ethnic backgrounds. 2. Neutral and 19 other expressions are captured for each person. 3. For every RGBD raw data record, a set of facial features points are located. 4. Match feature points on color images to depth image mesh. 5. Construct a set of individual-specific expression blendshapes for each person. 6. A bilinear face model with attributes: identity and expression. 7. Advantages over other databases: much richer matching collection of expressions. 8. Applications: facial image manipulation; face component transfer; real-time performance-based facial image animation; facial animation retargeting from video to image|
