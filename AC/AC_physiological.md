|[Toward Machine Emotional Intelligence: Analysis of Affective Physiological State](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/538b/21803b23b3d870beab87440e79c4fed84e67.pdf)|IEEE TPAMI 2001|1. Develop a machine's ability to recognize human affective state given four physiological signals. 2. Propose new features and algorithms and compare their performances for the daily variation issues (features of different emotions on the same day cluster more closely than features of the same emotion on different days)|
|[DEAP: A Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/doc/tac_special_issue_2011.pdf)|IEEE TAC 2012|1. Present a multimodal dataset for the analysis of human affective states, comprising EEG and peripheral physiological signals of 32 participants. 2. An extensive analysis of the participants' ratings during the experiment is presented. Correlates between the EEG signal frequencies and the participants' ratings are investigated. 3. Methods and results are presented for single-trial classification of arousal, valence, and like/dislike ratings using the modalities of EEG, peripheral physiological signals, and multimedia content analysis.|
