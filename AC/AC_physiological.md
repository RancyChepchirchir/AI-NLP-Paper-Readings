|[Toward Machine Emotional Intelligence: Analysis of Affective Physiological State](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/538b/21803b23b3d870beab87440e79c4fed84e67.pdf)|IEEE TPAMI 2001|1. Develop a machine's ability to recognize human affective state given four physiological signals. 2. Propose new features and algorithms and compare their performances for the daily variation issues (features of different emotions on the same day cluster more closely than features of the same emotion on different days)|
|[DEAP: A Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/doc/tac_special_issue_2011.pdf)|IEEE TAC 2012|1. Present a multimodal dataset for the analysis of human affective states, comprising EEG and peripheral physiological signals of 32 participants. 2. An extensive analysis of the participants' ratings during the experiment is presented. Correlates between the EEG signal frequencies and the participants' ratings are investigated. 3. Methods and results are presented for single-trial classification of arousal, valence, and like/dislike ratings using the modalities of EEG, peripheral physiological signals, and multimedia content analysis.|
|[EEG Databases for Emotion Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6680130/)|ICCW 2013|1. Two affective EEG databases are presented. 2. The EEG data are rated by the participants with arousal, valence, and dominance levels. The correlation between powers of different EEG bands and the affective ratings is studied. 3. Use of a Fractal Dimension feature in combination with statistical and Higher Order Crossings (HOC) features gives us results with the best accuracy.|
|[Emotional state classification from EEG data using machine learning approach](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231213009867)|Neurocomputing 2014|1. Systematically compares three kinds of existing EEG features for emotion classification, introduces an efficient feature smoothing method for removing the noise unrelated to emotion task, and proposes a simple approach to tracking the trajectory of emotion changes with manifold learning. 2. Design a movie induction experiment that spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states and collect an EEG data set of six subjects. 3. Results show that (a) power spectrum feature is superior to other two kinds of features; (b) a linear dynamic system based feature smoothing method can significantly improve emotion classification accuracy; and (c) the trajectory of emotion changes can be visualized by reducing subject-independent features with manifold learning.|
|[DREAMER: A Database for Emotion Recognition Through EEG and ECG Signals From Wireless Low-cost Off-the-Shelf Devices](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7887697/)|IEEE JBHI 2017|1. Present DREAMER, a multimodal database consisting of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals recorded during affect elicitation by means of audio-visual stimuli. 2. A baseline for participant-wise affect recognition using EEG and ECG-based features, as well as their fusion, was established through supervised classification experiments using support vector machines (SVMs).|
|[EEG-Based Emotion Recognition via Fast and Robust Feature Smoothing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7887697/)|ICBI 2017|1. Propose a feature smoothing method to alleviate noise and high dimension problems of EEG signals. 2. Extract six statistical features from raw EEG signals and apply a simple yet cost-effective feature smoothing method to improve the recognition accuracy.|
|[Emotions Recognition Using EEG Signals: A Survey](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7946165/)|IEEE TAC 2018|1. Present a survey of the neurophysiological research performed from 2009 to 2016, providing a comprehensive overview of the existing works in emotion recognition using EEG signals. 2. Focus our analysis in the main aspects involved in the recognition process (e.g., subjects, features extracted, classifiers), and compare the works per them. 2. Propose a set of good practice recommendations that researchers must follow to achieve reproducible, replicable, well-validated and high-quality results.|
