Develop a machine's ability to recognize human affective state given four physiological signals. 2. Propose new features and algorithms and compare their performances for the daily variation issues (features of different emotions on the same day cluster more closely than features of the same emotion on different days)|
|[DEAP: A Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/doc/tac_special_issue_2011.pdf)|IEEE TAC 2012|Present a multimodal dataset for the analysis of human affective states, comprising EEG and peripheral physiological signals of 32 participants|
